        Morocco is a country in Africa. It is the most northwestern country. It borders the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. It borders Algeria to the west.

        Folk stories are a very important part of Moroccan culture. These are stories that tell about the beliefs, traditions, and history of Morocco and the Moroccan people. From these stories, listeners can learn a lot about Morocco and what is important to Moroccans.
        Moroccan Folk Stories
        "Folk" means people from a particular country who have a certain way of life.
            
        There are many Moroccan Folk stories that are still told throughout Morocco today. These stories each teach lessons and give an insight to Moroccan culture. An "insight" is an understanding of something.
            
        Many Moroccan folk stories have similar themes. A "theme" is an idea or topic that repeats itself. Travelling is an important theme in these folk stories as are animals, Islam, family, and respect. The stories always feature (talk about) the landscape of Morocco from the deserts to the mountains and the cities.
